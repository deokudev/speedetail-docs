[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is the powerful alternative to Spotlight.
By integrating Inkdrop and Alfred, you can instantly search your notes from Alfred.

## Download the Alfred Workflow

Go to [the Releases page](https://github.com/inkdropapp/inkdrop-alfred-workflow/releases) and click the file `Inkdrop.alfredworkflow`.

## Configuration

### 1. Set up the local http server

The workflow accesses your notes via HTTP locally.
You have to configure the app to open a HTTP endpoint.
See [the instruction](https://developers.inkdrop.app/guides/access-the-local-database#accessing-via-http-advanced) for more detail.

### 2. Set up the workflow

Click `[x]` button to configure environment variables of the workflow.

![configure workflow][configure-1]

Specify your server configuration.

![configure server][configure-2]

## Usage

You can search using `ink {query}` in Alfred. You can use [the same qualifiers](https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/searching-notes/#filter-notes-with-special-qualifiers) for filtering notes.
